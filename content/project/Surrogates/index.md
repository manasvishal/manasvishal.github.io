The BHPTNRSurrogate(s) package provides access to a family of surrogate gravitational waveform models built on waveforms generated with point-particle black hole perturbation theory (ppBHPT) framework. These models extend from comparable mass-ratio to large mass-ratio regimes and are calibrated to numerical relativity (NR) waveforms in the comprable-mass-ratio regime.
