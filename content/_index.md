      title: '📚 My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        My research explores the computational frontiers of gravitational wave science, focusing on high-performance computing and simulation techniques to model astrophysical phenomena, particularly black holes. Under the guidance of Dr. Scott Field at UMass Dartmouth, I work on advancing methods for gravitational wave analysis, contributing to projects relevant to observatories like LIGO and the space-based LISA mission. 
        
        A core area of my research involves developing algorithms that enhance the accuracy and efficiency of complex simulations, leveraging GPU acceleration and distributed computing. By coupling hyperboloidal compactification with nodal DG schemes, my work aims to improve superconvergence in simulations, allowing for more precise insights into the dynamics of gravitational waves. This research not only addresses fundamental questions in astrophysics but also expands the computational capabilities available for data-intensive scientific inquiries.
