# My Hugo webpage

I forked this repository from https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv and made a few changes to the template like adding the archives page and the black hole page.

I got the code for the black hole javascript animation from a [codepen](https://codepen.io/Aditya-bhoyar/pen/eYXJzve). The original had purple color which is fascinating itself but I prefer the orange-yellow hue.
